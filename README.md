# Collab Session – Real-time Code Sharing in Class

A **Visual Studio Code extension** with a **Node.js WebSocket backend** that enables **lecturers** to host live coding sessions and **students** to participate in real time.

## 🚀 Overview

**Collab Session** allows seamless collaboration between host and students during coding classes.

### Key Features
- 🧑‍🏫 **Host** can create and manage live sessions.  
- 👩‍🎓 **Students** can join, edit code, and submit answers.  
- 🔄 **Real-time synchronization** of questions and submissions.  
- 💬 **Feedback system** between host and students.  
- 📡 Works on LAN (IPv4) or via ngrok for remote use.

## ⚙️ Requirements
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)  
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## 🧩 Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Start the WebSocket Server
Run the server from the project root:

#### • Windows PowerShell / Linux / macOS
<!-- ```bash -->
windows PowerShell:
    node server.js

The server starts by default on ws://localhost:3000

> 💡 You can update the Host IP anytime from VS Code using the command:  
> `Collab Session: Set Host IP` (e.g. `192.168.x.x`)


### 2️⃣ Launch the Extension
1. Open the project folder in **VS Code**.  
2. Press **F5** to run the extension.  
3. A new VS Code window will open *(Extension Development Host)*.  
4. The **Home** panel loads automatically.


## 🧠 How It Works
### 👨‍🏫 Lecturer (Host)
1. Create a new session → session ID is automatically copied to clipboard.  
2. Share the session ID with students.  
3. Type a question and send it to all participants.  
4. View submitted answers and provide feedback.  
5. Close the session when finished.


### 👩‍🎓 Students
1. Join using the **Session ID** and your **name**.  
2. Open your **“My Answer”** tab to write code.  
3. Click **Send My Answer** (or use the toolbar button).  
4. View received feedback from the host.

| Description | Role | Command |
|--------------|------|----------|
| Opens main control panel | All | `Collab Session: Show Home` |
| Creates a new session | Host | `Collab Session: Create Session` |
| Joins existing session | Student | `Collab Session: Join Session` |
